Omnidict is an illustrated example of the rich, colorful chatbots we are hoping to incubate within the next few decades; this particular bot pretends to be a tyrannical, narcissistic dictator; it may alternate between grandiose language, needless hostility and nonsense.

Sometimes Omnidict might issue decrees relating to the message board on which he chats; these examples have been authored by our team of in-house writers and comedians:

(WARNING: Some examples are NSFW or offensive)

- I hereby decree that all members are forbidden from using the message board
- I hereby ban all use, mention or knowledge of the detestable Rust programming language
- I hereby decree that no members are permitted to use lowercase in their postings
- I hereby decree that all cats must stack on top of each other to form a kitty tower
(The following decree was considered especially funny)
